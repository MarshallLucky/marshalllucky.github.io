## Enthalpy is Heat Absorbed under Constant Pressure
Claim: The change in enthalpy, $ \Delta H $ is the heat absorbed (or released) by a system that undergoes a state change under conditions of constant pressure.  To see this, note that enthalpy is defined as:

$ H = E + P \cdot V $

so that the enthalpy change due to the state change is:

$ \Delta H = \Delta E + P \cdot \Delta V $

but what is $ \Delta E $ ?  It is the change in the internal energy of the system which is in turn equal to the heat absorbed less the work done by the system:

$ \Delta E = q + w = q - P \cdot \Delta V $

where again we are assuming $ \Delta P = 0 $ since the state change is assumed to take place under conditions of constant pressure.  Let us now use this last relation to rexpress the enthalpy change as:

$ \Delta H = \Delta E + P \cdot \Delta V = q - P \cdot \Delta V + P \cdot \Delta V $

and thus we arrive at our original claim that the enthalpy is the amount of heat absorbed by the system as a consequence of a state change, i.e., the energy change of the system due to heat absorbed, only:

$ \Delta H = q $.
