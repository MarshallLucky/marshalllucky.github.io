# Thermodynamics Applications to Cell Biology

---

## 1. Core Principles

- **First Law (Energy Conservation):**  
  Energy cannot be created or destroyed, only transformed.  
  In cells: chemical energy → ATP → mechanical, electrical, or heat energy.

- **Second Law (Entropy):**  
  Total entropy (system + surroundings) increases.  
  Cells maintain local order by expending energy (e.g., ATP hydrolysis).

## 2. Gibbs Free Energy

Governs spontaneity at constant $T, P$:

$$
\Delta G = \Delta H - T \Delta S
$$

**Biological Meaning:**
- $\Delta G < 0$: Spontaneous (e.g., ATP hydrolysis).
- $\Delta G > 0$: Requires energy input (e.g., active transport).

**Coupling:**  
Endergonic reactions are driven by exergonic ones.  
Example: ATP hydrolysis powers biosynthetic pathways.

## 3. Chemical Potential (μ)

For species $i$:

$$
\mu_i = \mu_i^\circ + RT \ln a_i
$$

**Applications in Cells:**
- Diffusion: movement down chemical potential gradient.
- Active transport: movement against μ requires energy (ATP or electrochemical gradient).

---

## 4. Membrane Transport & Electrochemical Gradients

Free energy for ion transport:

$$
\Delta G = RT \ln \frac{[C]_\text{in}}{[C]_\text{out}} + zF\Delta \psi
$$

Where:
- $z$ = ion charge
- $F$ = Faraday constant
- $\Delta \psi$ = membrane potential

**Examples:**
- Na⁺/K⁺ ATPase maintains gradients.
- Proton motive force drives ATP synthesis in mitochondria.

## 5. ATP: Energy Currency

Hydrolysis reaction:

$$
\text{ATP} + H_2O \to \text{ADP} + P_i \quad \Delta G^\circ' \approx -30.5\ \text{kJ/mol}
$$

**Role:**
- Couples exergonic and endergonic processes.
- Enables mechanical work, transport, and biosynthesis.

## 6. Enzyme Catalysis

**Key Point:**  
Enzymes lower activation energy (kinetic effect), but **do not change ΔG**.  
Reaction direction is determined by thermodynamics, not catalysis.

---

## 7. Osmotic and Mechanical Work

Osmotic pressure:

$$
\Pi = RTC
$$

Maintains water balance in cells.

**Mechanical Work:**
Muscle contraction and intracellular transport use ATP hydrolysis energy.
