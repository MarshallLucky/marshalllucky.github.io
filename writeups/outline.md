## Mathematics
- Role of stochastic calculus in thermodynamics and statistical mechanics
  - ChatGPT list of areas in which it is used "is stochastic calculus useful for thermodynamics and/or statistical mechanics?
    - https://chatgpt.com/c/68a1c730-f6ec-8333-852e-56841305e8f4
    - Yes, stochastic calculus is very useful for thermodynamics and statistical mechanics. Key applications include:
      - Langevin SDE for Brownian motion
      - Fokker-Planck equation for probability evolution
      - stochastic thermodynamics (entropy production, fluctuation theorems)
      - Kramers' rate theory for escape rates
      - Non-equilibrium statistical mechanics (response, transport coefficients)
      - Chemical master equation for reaction networks
      - Gillespie algorithm for stochastic simulation
    - Yes, stochastic calculus is central to nonequilibrium statistical mechanics. Key points:
      - Langevin equation for particle dynamics
      - Fokker-Planck equation for probability distribution evolution
      - Jarzynski equality for free energy differences
      - Stratonovich vs Itô calculus for noise handling in modeling
      - Interpretation matters: Stratonovich preserves the chain rule, Itô adds correction.
