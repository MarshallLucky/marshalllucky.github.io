Activate MSYS2: In Command Prompt, navigate to Ruby directory (e.g., cd C:\Ruby32-x64) and run ridk.cmd enable, follow prompts.

2. Create and Configure the RepositoryCreate Repo: Log into github.com, click “+” > “New repository.” Name it marshalllucky.github.io, set to private, initialize with README, and create.
Clone Repo: In Git Bash, run git clone https://github.com/marshalllucky/marshalllucky.github.io.git, then cd marshalllucky.github.io.

3. Set Up the Modern Resume ThemeFork or Download: Fork sproogen.github.io/modern-resume-theme or download ZIP, copy contents into marshalllucky.github.io folder.
Install Dependencies: Run bundle install in the repo folder.
Configure: Edit _config.yml with:yaml

Replace placeholders (e.g., [yourpreferreddomain].com, [yourlinkedinurl]) with your details.

5. Enable Paper Copy CapabilityInstall wkhtmltopdf: Download from wkhtmltopdf.org or use choco install wkhtmltopdf with Chocolatey, verify with wkhtmltopdf -V.
Create PDF Layout: In _layouts, create resume.pdf.liquid with:liquid

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head><title>Resume</title></head>
<body>
  <h1>{{ site.data.data.name }}</h1>
  <h2>About</h2><p>{{ site.data.data.about }}</p>
  <h2>Experience</h2><ul>{% for job in site.data.data.experience %}<li><strong>{{ job.title }}</strong> at {{ job.company }} ({{ job.dates }}): {% for detail in job.details %}{{ detail }}<br>{% endfor %}</li>{% endfor %}</ul>
  <h2>Education</h2><ul>{% for edu in site.data.data.education %}<li><strong>{{ edu.degree }}</strong> at {{ edu.institution }}: {{ edu.details }}</li>{% endfor %}</ul>
  <!-- Add Certifications, Skills, Projects similarly -->
</body>
</html>

Generate PDF: Run bundle exec jekyll serve, then wkhtmltopdf http://localhost:4000/resume.pdf.liquid resume.pdf. Save the PDF from _site.

6. Implement Privacy ControlsPassword Protection: Edit index.html to add:html

<script>
  if (prompt('Enter password:') !== 'yourpassword123') {
    window.location.href = 'about:blank';
  }
</script>

Replace yourpassword123 with a secure password.
Private Repository: Keep repo private, enable Pages with main branch (requires GitHub Pro, ~$4/month, or share URL manually).
Contact Form: Add to index.html before the script:html

<form action="https://formspree.io/your@email.com" method="POST">
  <label>Name: <input type="text" name="name"></label>
  <input type="submit" value="Request Access">
</form>

Replace your@email.com with your email.

7. Push and PublishCommit Changes: Run git add ., git commit -m "Initial resume with privacy and PDF", git push origin main.
Enable Pages: In GitHub, go to “Settings” > “Pages,” set source to main, and wait for deployment.
Test: Visit https://marshalllucky.github.io, enter the password, and verify. Download the PDF for paper use.

8. Maintain and ShareUpdate: Edit data.yml, rebuild with jekyll build, and push. PDF updates automatically.
Share: Email the URL with the password to targeted contacts.

NotesReplace all placeholders with your details.
Install wkhtmltopdf and test PDF generation as needed.
Share errors or specific issues for troubleshooting.

Proceed with creating the repo and installing Ruby if not done. Let me know what you need next.
